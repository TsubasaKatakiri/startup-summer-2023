Startup Summer 2023 Test Task

This project is created using Vite.
Technologies used in this project are:
- React + Typescript;
- Mantine;
- Redux-Toolkit, RTKQuery.

Notices:
1. Password authorization and access token refresh queries are already implemented in baseQueryWithReauth, not as separate endpoints(it's specially for authomatic login/relogin, acts like axios interceptor), see store/baseApiQuery.ts.
2. Search options on resolutions smaller than 992px are accessible through 'Options' button near the search bar.
